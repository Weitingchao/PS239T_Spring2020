# Subsetting

When working with data, you'll need to subset objects early and often. Luckily, R's subsetting operators are powerful and fast. Mastery of subsetting allows you to succinctly express complex operations in a way that few other languages can match. Subsetting is hard to learn because you need to master a number of interrelated concepts:

* The three subsetting operators, `[`, `[[`, and `$`.

* Important differences in behavior for different objects (e.g., vectors, lists, factors, matrices, and data frames).

* The use of subsetting in conjunction with assignment.

This unit helps you master subsetting by starting with the simplest type of subsetting: subsetting an atomic vector with `[`. It then gradually extends your knowledge, first to more complicated data types (like dataframes and lists), and then to the other subsetting operators, `[[` and `$`. You'll then learn how subsetting and assignment can be combined to modify parts of an object, and, finally, you'll see a large number of useful applications.

**Outline**

1. [Data types](#data-types) starts by teaching you about `[`. You'll start by learning the four ways to subset atomic vectors. You'll then learn how those four methods act when used to subset lists, matrices, and data frames.
2. [Subsetting operators](#subsetting-operators) expands your knowledge of subsetting operators to include `[[` and `$`, focusing on the important principles of simplifying vs. preserving.
3. In [Subsetting and assignment](#subassignment) you'll learn the art of sub assignment, combining subsetting and assignment to modify parts  of an object.
4. [Applications](#applications) leads you through important, but not obvious, applications of subsetting to solve problems that you often encounter in a data analysis, using the tools above.
5. [Bonus Items](#bonus-items) show you some additional details of how to work with your data and make your code more efficient, including by distinguishing when you want to simplify vs. preserve your data.

**********************************************************

## 1. Subsetting Automic data with '[' {#data-types}

It's easiest to learn how subsetting works for atomic vectors, and then how it generalizes to higher dimensions and other more complicated objects. We'll start with `[`, the most commonly used operator. [Subsetting operators](#subsetting-operators) will cover `[[` and `$`, the two other main subsetting operators.

Let's explore the different types of subsetting with a simple vector, `x`. 

```{r}
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)
```

Note that the number after the decimal point gives the original position in the vector.

### 1.1. Five methods of subsetting automic vector 

#### a. Positive integers

__Positive integers__ return elements at the specified positions:

```{r}
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)
x
x[1]
x[c(3, 1)]

# `order(x)` gives the positions of smallest to largest values.
order(x)
x[order(x)]
x[c(1, 3, 2, 4)]

# Duplicated indices yield duplicated values
x[c(1, 1)]
```

#### b. Negative integers

__Negative integers__ omit elements at the specified positions:

```{r}
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)
x[-1]
x[-c(3, 1)]
```

Note: you can't mix positive and negative integers in a single subset:

```{r, error = TRUE}
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)
x[c(-1, 2)]
```

#### c. Character vectors

__Character vectors__ to return elements with matching names. This only works if the vector is named.
 
```{r}
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)

# apply names
names(x) <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
x

# subset using names
x[c("d", "c", "a")]

# Like integer indices, you can repeat indices
x[c("a", "a", "a")]

# Careful! names are always matched exactly
x <- c(abc = 1, def = 2)
x
x[c("a", "d")]
```


#### 3. Logical vectors

__Logical vectors__ keep elements where the corresponding logical value is `TRUE`.

```{r}
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)

x[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]
```

This is probably the most useful type of subsetting because you write the expression that creates the logical vector

```{r}
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)

# this returns a logical vector
x > 3
x

# use a conditional statement to create an implicit logical vector
x[x > 3]
```

You can combine conditional statements with `&` (and), `|` (or), and `!` (not)

```{r}
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)

# combing two conditional statements with &
x > 3 & x < 5


x[x > 3 & x < 5]

# combing two conditional statements with |
x < 3 | x > 5 
x[x < 3 | x > 5]

# combining conditional statements with !
!x > 5 
x[!(x > 5)]
```

### 1.2. Useful Tricks for subsetting with [

#### 1.2.1. Piping 

Instead of writing out the original variable name multiple times, you can use the period symbol `.` and the piping operator `%>%` to subset. 
```{r}
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)

# use a conditional statement to create an implicit logical vector
x %>% .[. > 3]

# combing two conditional statements with |
x %>% .[. < 3 | . > 5]
```

#### 1.2.1. `%in%`, `%chin%`, `%between%`, and `%like%`.

Note: To use these operators, you will need to load the package `data.table`.

One way to generate implicit conditional statements is using the `%in%` operator, which works like the `in` keywords in Python.
```{r}
# generate implicit logical vectors through the %in% operator
x %in% c(3.3, 4.2)
x
x[x %in% c(3.3, 4.2)]
```

For character vectors, `%chin%` is a faster version of `%in%`.

```{r}
# Use built-in dataset
data(state)

# Duplicate vector to make bigger 
state.abb %<>% rep(., 100)

# Speed of %in%
start.time <- Sys.time() #start clock
state.abb %<>% .[. %in% c("OR","CA")] 
(Sys.time() - start.time) %>% print() #time elapsed 

# Speed of %chin%
start.time <- Sys.time() #start clock
state.abb %<>% .[. %chin% c("OR","CA")] 
(Sys.time() - start.time) %>% print() #time elapsed 
```

`%between%` finds numbers between two values. 
```{r}
x20 <- c(1:20)
x20 %between% c(1,10)
```

`%like%` is a wrapper for `grepl`. We will revisit this when we cover regular expressions (regex). Documentation can be found [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/DescTools/versions/0.99.19/topics/%25like%25).

### 1.3. Exercise

Subset `country.vector` below to return every value EXCEPT "Canada" and "Brazil"

```{r eval = FALSE}
country.vector<-c("Afghanistan", "Canada", "Sierra Leone", "Denmark", "Japan", "Brazil")

# Do it using positive integers

country.vector[c(___________________)]

# Do it using negative integers

country.vector[-c(_______________)]

# Do it using a logical vector

country.vector[c(________________)]

# Do it using a conditional statement (and an implicit logical vector)

country.vector[!________ %in% c(_________)]

```

## 2. Matrices

The most common way of subsetting matrices (2d) is a simple generalization of 1d subsetting: you supply a 1d index for each dimension, separated by a comma. Blank subsetting is now useful because it lets you keep all rows or all columns.

```{r}
a <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
colnames(a) <- c("A", "B", "C")
a

# rows come first, then columns
a[c(1, 2), ]
a[c(T, F, T), c("B", "A")]
a[0, -2]
a[c(1,2) , -2]
```


## 3. Data frames

Data from data frames can be addressed like matrices (with row and column indicators separated by a comma).

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 4:6, y = 3:1, z = letters[1:3])
df

# return only the rows where x == 6
df[df$x == 6, ]

# return the first and third row
df[c(1, 3), ]

# return the first and third row, and the first and second column
df[c(1, 3), c(1,2)]
```

Data frames possess the characteristics of both lists and matrices: if you subset with a single vector, they behave like lists, and return only the columns.

```{r}
# There are two ways to select columns from a data frame
# Like a list:
df[c("x", "z")]
# Like a matrix
df[, c("x", "z")]

```

But there's an important difference when you select a single column: matrix subsetting simplifies by default, list subsetting does not.

```{r}
(df["x"])
class((df["x"]))

(df[, "x"])
class((df[, "x"]))
```

Because data frames are lists of columns, you can use `[[` or `$` to extract columns (see below). 

```{r}
df[, "x"]
df$x
df[["x"]]
```

### 3.1. Exercises

1.  Fix each of the following common data frame subsetting errors:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# check out what we're dealing with
mtcars

# fix
mtcars[mtcars$cyl = 4, ]
mtcars[-1:4, ]
mtcars[mtcars$cyl <= 5]
mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4 | 6, ]

# answers
mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4, ]
mtcars[-c(1:4), ]
mtcars[mtcars$cyl <= 5,]
mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4 | mtcars$cyl == 6, ]
```

2.  Why does `mtcars[1:20]` return an error? How does it differ from the 
similar `mtcars[1:20, ]`?


**********************************************************

## 4. Lists

Subsetting a list works in the same way as subsetting an atomic vector BUT we often want to use `[[` or `$` instead of `[`. 

Using `[` will always return a list; `[[` and `$`, as described below, let you pull out the components of the list.

* `[[` is similar to `[`, except it can only return a single value and it allows you to pull pieces out of a list. 
* `$` is a useful shorthand for `[[` combined with character subsetting. 

Examples: 
```{r}
l <- list('comp1' = c(1,2,3), 'comp2' = 2)
l
  
l[1]
l[[1]]
l['comp1']
l$comp1
l[['comp1']]
```

### 4.1. `[[`

You need `[[` when working with lists. This is because when `[` is applied to a list it always returns a list: it never gives you the contents of the list. To get the contents, you need `[[`:

>  "If list `x` is a train carrying objects, then `x[[5]]` is
> the object in car 5; `x[4:6]` is a train of cars 4-6." 
>
> --- @RLangTip

Because data frames are lists of columns, you can use `[[` to extract a column from data frames:

```{r}
mtcars

# these two are equivalent
mtcars[[1]] 
mtcars[ ,1]

# which differs from this:
mtcars[1]
```

### 4.2. `$`

`$` is a shorthand operator, where `x$y` is equivalent to `x[["y", exact = FALSE]]`.  It's often used to access variables in a data frame:

```{r}
# these two are equivalent
mtcars[["cyl"]]
mtcars$cyl
```

One common mistake with `$` is to try and use it when you have the name of a column stored in a variable:

```{r}
var <- "cyl"
# Doesn't work - mtcars$var translated to mtcars[["var"]]
mtcars$var

# Instead use [[
mtcars[[var]]
```

### 4.3. Exercises

1.  Take a look at the linear model below: 

```{r}
mod <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
summary(mod)
```

Extract the R squared from the model summary.

```{r, eval=FALSE, error = TRUE}
mod.sum <- summary(mod)

# Fill in here

```

## 5. Subsetting with `dplyr`

2D data structures like data frames (and tibbles) can be subset using the dplyr functions. In general, these are easier to use than base R. 

For this section, we will use the gapminder dataset from last week. 
```{r}
library(gapminder) #includes gapminder dataset 

# Look at structure 
glimpse(gapminder)

# Print random sample of 10 rows 
gapminder %>% sample_n(10) %>% print.data.frame()
```


### 5.1. Subset Columns 

`select()` function: 
```{r}
head(select(gapminder, country, pop))

# Subset columns 
gapminder %>% select(country, pop) %>% head()
gapminder %>% select(-country) %>% head()

# Reorder columns 
gapminder %>% select(pop, country) %>% head()

# Subset columns with variable names that match string  
gapminder %>% select(contains("co"))

# Subset columns by number 
gapminder %>% select(1:2)
```

Tidyverse select helpers:

* starts_with(): Starts with a prefix.
* ends_with(): Ends with a suffix.
* contains(): Contains a literal string.
* matches(): Matches a regular expression.
* num_range(): Matches a numerical range like x01, x02, x03.
* one_of(): Matches variable names in a character vector.
* everything(): Matches all variables.
* last_col(): Select last variable, possibly with an offset.


### 5.2. Subset Rows 

`slice()` to subset by row number
```{r}
gapminder %>% slice(40:45)
```

`filter()` to subset otherwise 
```{r}
gapminder %>% filter(country=="France") %>% head()
gapminder %>% filter(pop > 1e8) %>% head()
```

### 5.3. Ordering 

`arrange()` sorts rows 

```{r}
# Smallest to largest
gapminder %>% arrange(pop) %>% head()
# Largest to smallest 
gapminder %>% arrange(desc(pop)) %>% head()
# A to Z
gapminder %>% arrange(continent) %>% head()
# Z to A
gapminder %>% arrange(desc(continent)) %>% head()
```

### 5.4. Unique rows 

`distinct` removes all duplicate rows.

```{r}
# No duplicate rows
gapminder %>% nrow
gapminder %>% distinct %>% nrow

# Duplicate values within columns 
gapminder %>% distinct(continent)
```


### 5.5. Exercises {.tabset}

#### Questions 

Remember to use good commenting practices! 

1. Subset gapminder dataset to only Angola and Brazil in 2007-2010. Drop continent, lifeExp, and gdpPercap columns. 
```{r}

```

2. Subset gapminder dataset to 5 largest countries by gdpPercap in Africa in 2007. 
```{r}

```





#### Answers 

Here is one possible way to answer the exercises...

A1. Subset gapminder dataset to only Angola and Brazil in 2007-2010. Drop continent, lifeExp, and gdpPercap columns. 
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  # Subset to angola and brazil 
    filter(country %in% c("Angola", "Brazil")) %>%
  # Subset by year 
    filter(year %between% c(2007L,2010L)) %>%
  # Select columns
    select(country, year, pop)
```
While you could combine these filters into one using the `&` operator, seperating them onto two lines is also acceptable and easier to read. 

A2. Subset gapminder dataset to 5 largest countries by gdpPercap in Africa in 2007. 
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  # Filter by year
    filter(year == 2007) %>%
  # Filter to Africa
    filter(continent == "Africa") %>%
  # Arrange by gdpPercap
    arrange(desc(gdpPercap)) %>%
  # first 5 rows
    head(5)
```

## 6. Bonus Items {#bonus-items}

### 6.1 Simplifying vs. preserving subsetting {#simplify-preserve}

It's important to understand the distinction between simplifying and preserving subsetting. Simplifying subsets returns the simplest possible data structure that can represent the output, and is useful interactively because it usually gives you what you want. Preserving subsetting keeps the structure of the output the same as the input, and is generally better for programming because the result will always be the same type. Omitting `drop = FALSE` when subsetting matrices and data frames is one of the most common sources of programming errors. (It will work for your test cases, but then someone will pass in a single column data frame and it will fail in an unexpected and unclear way.)

Unfortunately, how you switch between simplifying and preserving differs for different data types, as summarized in the table below.

|             | Simplifying               | Preserving                                   |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Vector      | `x[[1]]`                  | `x[1]`                                       |
| List        | `x[[1]]`                  | `x[1]`                                       |
| Factor      | `x[1:4, drop = T]`        | `x[1:4]`                                     |
| Data frame  | `x[, 1]` __or__ `x[[1]]`  | `x[, 1, drop = F]` __or__ `x[1]`             |

Preserving is the same for all data types: you get the same type of output as input. Simplifying behavior varies slightly between different data types, as described below:

*   __Atomic vector__: removes names.

```{r}
x <- c(a = 1, b = 2)
x
x[1]
x[[1]]
```

*   __List__: return the object inside the list, not a single element list.

```{r}
y <- list(a = 1, b = 2)
y
str(y[1])
str(y[[1]])
```

*   __Factor__: drops any unused levels.

```{r}
z <- factor(c("a", "b"))
z[1]
z[1, drop = TRUE]
```

*   __Matrix__: if any of the dimensions has length 1, drops that dimension.

    ```{r}
a <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2)
a
a[1, , drop = FALSE]
a[1, ]
    ```

*   __Data frame__: if output is a single column, returns a vector instead of 
    a data frame.

    ```{r}
df <- data.frame(a = 1:2, b = 3:4)
df
str(df[1])
str(df[[1]])
str(df[, "a", drop = FALSE])
str(df[, "a"])
```
