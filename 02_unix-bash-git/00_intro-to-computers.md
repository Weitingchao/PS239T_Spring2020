# Introduction to Computer Stuff

> ### Learning objectives
> 
> * Explain why and when programming is better than alternatives 
> * Introduce mental model of computers
> * Introduce computer languages & commenting 


### 1. Can’t I just use excel?

Problem with ‘easy to use’ software like Excel: 
* **Time** -- it takes longer 
* **Limitations** -- some things can’t be done
* **Traceability** -- harder to make changes and check work

*Example:* collecting and organizing text from 80,000 newspaper articles 
* Excel: 4,000 hours (166 days)
* Python: <3 hours for writing and running code

### 2. Do I need to know how computers work?

Nah… Very few people in the world understand how computers work. 
* Some people try to hide this fact by pretending that computer stuff is harder than it is. 

'Useful fictions' help us remember patterns
* Most people have an incomplete mental model of how a computer works
* Learn patterns through trial and error (usually)
* Our mental model doesn’t have to be very sophisticated
* But sometimes we need to update it in order to make sense of a more advanced topic 

### 3. What is a programming language?

*A programming language is a way of communicating with your computer and telling it to do something.*

Similar to a human language… 
* Many ways to communicate an idea BUT it might be easier or faster to express in a particular language or with a particular sentence structure. 
* Same 'grammatical structures' exist in multiple languages.

However, not exactly like a human language...
* Stricter rules & more similarities across languages 
* Higher vs. lower-level languages 
* Application-specific languages: Programs like R have their own languages designed for a specific purpose (i.e. data analysis and stats). 

### 4. What is commenting? Why is it good?

Even once we learn computer languages, it’s still faster to communicate some things in a human language. 

When we code, we leave ourselves comments that describe what we are doing in words. 
* Always include purpose of code
* Always include ‘headings’ and ‘topic sentences’ 
* Include additional details if you won’t be able to glance at a piece of code and immediately explain what it is doing in 6 months
