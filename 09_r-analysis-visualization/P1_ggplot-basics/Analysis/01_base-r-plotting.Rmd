# Plotting in R

There are two major sets of tools for creating plots in R:

* 1. [base](#1-r-base-graphics), which come with all R installations. These are mostly a quick and dirty tool--they're often hard to read and hard to modify, but can be useful if you need to whip up a quick histogram or something similar. 
* 2. [ggplot2](#2-ggplot2), a stand-alone package. This is going to be our primary tool for examining our data visually. It's very powerful and makes for beautiful visualizations, but the number of options makes for a steeper learning curve at first.  

Note that other plotting facilities do exist (notably **lattice**), but base and ggplot2 are by far the most popular. 

## 0) SET UP

### 0.1. Setup environment

```{r}
# remove all objects
rm(list=ls())

# check working directory
getwd()

# Change default plot dimensions
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=10, fig.height=6)
```

### 0.2. The dataset
For the following examples, we will using the gapminder dataset we saw last week. Gapminder is a country-year dataset with information on life expectancy, among other things.

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("../Data-raw/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
```

## 1) R BASE GRAPHICS

* *Minimal* call takes the following form

```{r, eval=F}
plot(x=)
```

```{r}
# Note that when asked to plot a single vector, R will assume the index positions of each vector element are the implied horizontal dimension
plot(x = dat$lifeExp) 
```

* *Basic* call takes the following form

```{r, eval=F}
plot(x=, y=)
```

```{r}
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp)
```

### 1a. Scatter and Line Plots

* The "type" argument accepts the following character indicators
* "p" -- point/scatter plots (default plotting behavior)

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="p")
```
* "l" -- line graphs

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
# Note that "line" does not create a smoothing line, just connected points
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="l") 

```
* "b" -- both line and point plots

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="b") 
```

### 1b. Histograms and Density Plots

* Certain plot types require different calls outside of the "type" argument
* Ex) Histograms

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
hist(x=dat$lifeExp)
hist(x=dat$lifeExp, breaks=5)
hist(x=dat$lifeExp, breaks=10)
```

* Ex) Density plots

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
# Create a density object (NOTE: be sure to remove missing values)
age.density<-density(x=dat$lifeExp, na.rm=T)
# Check the class of the object
class(age.density)
# View the contents of the object
age.density 

# Plot the density object
plot(x=age.density)
# Plot the density object, bandwidth of 0.5
plot(x=density(x=dat$lifeExp, bw=.5, na.rm=T))
# Plot the density object, bandwidth of 2
plot(x=density(x=dat$lifeExp, bw=2, na.rm=T))
# Plot the density object, bandwidth of 6
plot(x=density(x=dat$lifeExp, bw=6, na.rm=T)) 
```

### 1c. Labels

* Basic call with popular labeling arguments

```{r, eval=F}
plot(x=, y=, type="", xlab="", ylab="", main="") 
```

* From the previous example

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="p", xlab="GDP per cap", ylab="Life Expectancy", main="Life Expectancy ~ GDP") # Add labels for axes and overall plot
```

### 1d. Axis and size scaling

Currently itâ€™s hard to see the relationship between the points due to some strong outliers in GDP per capita. We can change the scale of units on the x axis using scaling arguments.

* Basic call with popular scaling arguments

```{r, eval=F}
plot(x=, y=, type="", xlim=, ylim=, cex=)
```

* From the previous example

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
# Create a basic plot
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="p")
# Limit gdp (x-axis) to between 1,000 and 20,000
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, xlim = c(1000,20000)) 
# Limit gdp (x-axis) to between 1,000 and 20,000, increase point size to 2
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, xlim = c(1000,20000), cex=2) 
# Limit gdp (x-axis) to between 1,000 and 20,000, decrease point size to 0.5
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, xlim = c(1000,20000), cex=0.5)  
```

### 1e. Graphical parameters

* Basic call with popular scaling arguments

```{r, eval=F}
plot(x=, y=, type="", col="", pch=, lty=, lwd=)
```

* Colors

```{r}
colors() # View all elements of the color vector
colors()[179] # View specific element of the color vector
```

Another option: [R Color Infographic](http://research.stowers-institute.org/efg/R/Color/Chart/ColorsChart1.jpg)
```{r, fig.cap=" "}
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="p", col=colors()[145]) # or col="gold3"
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="p", col="seagreen4") # or col=colors()[578]
```

* Point Styles and Widths

[A Good Reference](http://www.endmemo.com/program/R/pic/pchsymbols.png)

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
# Change point style to crosses
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="p", pch=3) 
# Change point style to filled squares
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="p",pch=15) 
# Change point style to filled squares and increase point size to 3
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="p",pch=15, cex=3) 
# Change point style to "w"
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="p", pch="w")
# Change point style to "$" and increase point size to 2
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="p",pch="$", cex=2) 
```

* Line Styles and Widths

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
# Line plot with solid line
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="l", lty=1)
# Line plot with medium dashed line
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="l", lty=2)
# Line plot with short dashed line
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="l", lty=3)
# Change line width to 2
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="l", lty=3, lwd=2)
# Change line width to 5
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="l",  lwd=5)
# Change line width to 10 and use dash-dot
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="l",  lty=4, lwd=10)
```

### 1f. Annotations, reference lines, and legends

* Text 

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
# plot the line first
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="p")
# now add the label
text(x=40000, y=50, labels="Evens Out", cex = .75)
```

* Reference Lines

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
# plot the line
plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="p")
# now the guides
abline(v=40000, h=75, lty=2)
```

So, plot gets us the basics--but it's VERY basic. As we said above, it's usually not much use except as a very rough sketch of our data, like we might want to generate during exploratory data analysis. For more than the basics, we need ggplot. 


## 2) Exporting

Two basic image types

### 2.1. **Raster/Bitmap** (.png, .jpeg)

Every pixel of a plot contains its own separate coding; not so great if you want to resize the image. In other words, if you expect to do resizing, or the chart might be displayed at a very different size than what you see on your screen (e.g., a conference presentation), you probably don't want these formats. 

Basic syntax: 
```{r, eval=F}
jpeg(filename="../Output/example.png", width=, height=)
plot(x,y)
dev.off()
```

Example: 
```{r}
jpeg(filename="../Output/example1.png")
  # plot the line
  plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="p")
  # now the guides
  abline(v=40000, h=75, lty=2)
dev.off()
```


### 2.2. **Vector** (.pdf, .ps)

Every element of a plot is encoded with a function that gives its coding conditional on several factors; great for resizing (presentations, etc.). 

Basic syntax: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
pdf(filename="../Output/example.pdf", width=, height=)
plot(x,y)
dev.off()
```

Example: 
```{r}
pdf("../Output/example1.pdf")
  # plot the line
  plot(x = dat$gdpPercap, y = dat$lifeExp, type="p")
  # now the guides
  abline(v=40000, h=75, lty=2)
dev.off()
```
