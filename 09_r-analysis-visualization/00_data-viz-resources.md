# Data Visualization Resources 

## Tidyverse (ggplot2)

[Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/) is a good resource for looking up basic ggplot2 code. 

Also try looking at the [Data visualization with ggplot2](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) cheatsheet.


## Colors 

Websites for picking colors: 
* [Colorbrewer website](http://colorbrewer2.org) allows users to browse color pallets available through the `colorbrewer` R package. 
* [Adobe Colorwheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) helps to find compatable colors. 
* [Viridis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) is a great color package.

## Inkscape 

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is a vector drawing software (like photoshop but better for graphs). If you need to make small adjustments to an existing graph, look through [Inkscape tutorials](https://inkscape.org/learn/tutorials/).
