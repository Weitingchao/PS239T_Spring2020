# Data Visualization Resources 

## Tidyverse (ggplot2)

[Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/) is a good resource for looking up basic ggplot2 code. 

Also try looking at the [Data visualization with ggplot2](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) cheatsheet.

## Other R Packages 

`ggthemes` contains additional themes for ggplot. More information can be found [here](https://mran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2016-12-03/web/packages/ggthemes/vignettes/ggthemes.html). 

`gridExtra` allows users to combine plots into a single image. More information can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/egg/vignettes/Ecosystem.html) and [here](http://edrub.in/ARE212/section08.html). 


## Visual design 

Books: 
* [Visualize This by Nathan Yau](https://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com/9781118140260)
* [Data Points: Visualization That Means Something by Nathan Yau](https://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com/9781118654934)

Other resources: 
* [Flowing Data](https://flowingdata.com/category/guides/)

## Colors 

Websites for picking colors: 
* [Colorbrewer website](http://colorbrewer2.org) allows users to browse color pallets available through the `colorbrewer` R package. 
* [Adobe Colorwheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) helps to find compatable colors. 

R Packages: 
* [Viridis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html)
* [Colorbrewer](https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-expand-color-palette-with-ggplot-and-rcolorbrewer/)


## Editing vector images

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is a vector drawing software (like photoshop but better for graphs). If you need to make small adjustments to an existing graph, look through [Inkscape tutorials](https://inkscape.org/learn/tutorials/). 


## Mapping

[Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) by Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, Jannes Muenchow is an excelent and in-depth discussion of mapping in R. It goes through many advanced mapping techniques including [animated maps](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html#animated-maps) and [interactive maps](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html#interactive-maps). The book references scripts with example code which can be found [here](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/tree/master/code).

Ed Rubin's website has two pages on mapping in R ([page 1](http://edrub.in/ARE212/section12.html) and [page 2](http://edrub.in/ARE212/section13.html)).

The `sf` (simple feature) package ([documentation here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/sf.pdf)) is a newer (but sometimes slower) method of mapping in R. More resources for sf mapping can be found here:

* [https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/)
